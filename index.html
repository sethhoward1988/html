            Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person (or persons) using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men. Which essentially means, no banks! There are no transaction fees and "psudo-anonymity." More merchants are beginning to accept them, including Overstock.com.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Bitcoins are stored in a “digital wallet,” which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer. If no backup of the wallet exist and a user's harddrive is destroyed, there is no way to recover the bitcoins. The wallet is a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. Unfortunately, bitcoin wallets are not insured by the FDIC.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                        Though each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public log, names of buyers and sellers are never revealed – only their wallet IDs. While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything without easily tracing it back to them. That’s why it has become the currency of choice for people online buying drugs or other illicit activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        No one knows what will become of bitcoin, though many will speculate. It is mostly unregulated, but that could change. Governments are concerned about taxation and their lack of control over the currency. 2014 is certain to be a defining year for the crypto-currency.

            Adding bitcoin payments to your website only requires basic HTML editing abilities. If you have access to your website's HTML code, then you can receive Bitcoin payments with Coinbase. These options can also be used for donations of variable amounts.
            </p>
            
            <strong>Payment Buttons:</strong><br>
            The simplest way to add bitcoin payments to your site. A payment button on your page opens a payment overlay. Once payment has been received by the user, they can close the overlay and return to the page.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Payment pages</strong><br>
            Payment pages are very similar to buttons, but instead of opening an overlay on your website, the user is directed to a special payment page hosted by Coinbase. Once the user completes purchase, they are redirected back to a success page of your choice.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Payment iFrames</strong><br>
            Payment iFrames embed the payment process directly into your web page — no need for a popup or page redirect.

            <p>Plugins can be installed in popular shopping cart services to enable bitcoin payments. Once you install a plugin, bitcoin payments will be enabled in your checkout flow.
</p><p>
We support plugins for many popular shopping cart systems:</p>

            <p>You can use your phone in person as a point of sale device (POS). Perfect for accepting bitcoin at your restaurant, event, or store.
</p><p>        
Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <img src="/img/works.png" alt="Supported Shopping Cart Systems" height="253" width="537">
            <ol>
              <li>On your Point of Sale device, enter the amount of the sale</li>
              <li>Then click to generate a QR code</li>
              <li>The customer scans this QR code with their own phone and taps to pay</li>
              <li>The customer receives payment confirmation</li>
              <li>So do you — sale complete!</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <br><br><br><br>
            <img src="/img/email.png" alt="Email Invoice" height="30" width="170">
            <hr>
            <p>Email invoices allow you to request payment for a specific amount from a user. Here's how it works:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create an invoice with a subject, the amount, and a brief description</li>
              <li>The user receives the invoice in their email inbox</li>
              <li>Clicking to pay brings them to a Coinbase payment page</li>
              <li>After they complete the payment, that's it! — you're both notified</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br><br><br>

            <p>You can use the Coinbase API to power custom products and enable them with the ability to send, receive, and request bitcoin, as well as create payment buttons dynamically, create user accounts, check the price, and a lot more.</p>
<p>
Using the API requires programming experience, but anyone with previous exposure to API integration should find it easy to use.
</p><p>
Here are a few examples of things you could do by integrating with our API:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create payment buttons dynamically — don't paste HTML for each one</li>
              <li>Create a bitcoin app — our own app just uses our public API</li>
            </ul>
