            <p>You can use the Coinbase API to power custom products and enable them with the ability to send, receive, and request bitcoin, as well as create payment buttons dynamically, create user accounts, check the price, and a lot more.</p>
<p>
Using the API requires programming experience, but anyone with previous exposure to API integration should find it easy to use.
</p><p>
Here are a few examples of things you could do by integrating with our API:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create payment buttons dynamically — don't paste HTML for each one</li>
              <li>Create a bitcoin app — our own app just uses our public API</li>
            </ul>
