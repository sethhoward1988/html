            Adding bitcoin payments to your website only requires basic HTML editing abilities. If you have access to your website's HTML code, then you can receive Bitcoin payments with Coinbase. These options can also be used for donations of variable amounts.

            <strong>Payment Buttons:</strong><br>
            The simplest way to add bitcoin payments to your site. A payment button on your page opens a payment overlay. Once payment has been received by the user, they can close the overlay and return to the page.

            <strong>Payment pages</strong><br>
            Payment pages are very similar to buttons, but instead of opening an overlay on your website, the user is directed to a special payment page hosted by Coinbase. Once the user completes purchase, they are redirected back to a success page of your choice.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Payment iFrames</strong><br>
            Payment iFrames embed the payment process directly into your web page â€” no need for a popup or page redirect.
